Aspiration Prayer
by Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok

dak ni di né tsé rab tamché du
From this moment on, throughout all my future lives,
lama lhakpé lha yi jé su zung
May I be cared for by the guru and supreme deity,
lab sum yönten gyatsö ter la wang
Master the treasury of oceanic qualities that come from the threefold training,
ten drö dön chen bé mé drubpar shok
And effortlessly bring vast benefit to the teachings and beings!

On the fourth day of the sixth month of the Fire Tiger year (1986), while generating the mind
set upon supreme awakening in the presence of one thousand members of the saṅgha, Ngawang
Lodrö Tsungmé spoke these words. May they be accomplished!
