Aspiration to be Cared For in Every Lifetime
by Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok

dü sum shekpé gyalwa tamché kun
All the victorious buddhas of past, present and future
rang ngor shenyen chok gi kur nangwa
Appear to us in the form of the supreme spiritual guide,
kadrin tsung dral yönten gyatsö ter
Unmatched in kindness, a treasury of oceanic qualities—
yishyin norbu khyé la solwa deb
Wish-fulfilling jewel, to you I pray!

khyé kyi drodül tabkhé chöpa ni
As you manifest all manner of activity,
nampa natsok ji tar ten jé kyang
Employing various skilful means to tame beings,
ké chik tsam yang lok ta mi kyé war
Bless me so that I do not develop wrong views even for an instant
ji dzé lekpar tongwar jin gyi lob
And perceive all that you do as perfect!

gang gi tse war dampé sung zang lé
Of the excellent advice that you have lovingly imparted
tsik zur tsam yang gongpar mi ché ching
I shall not disobey even so much as a single word;
pumpa gang jöi tsul gyi chin lap kun
Just like the contents of one vase poured into another,
ma lü dak gi gyü la powar shok
Let all your blessings be transferred into me!

gön khyö dak dang ma dak shying nam su
O Protector, as you display various enlightened forms
na tsok trulpé rol gar ngompé tsé
In pure and impure realms of existence,
dak kyang khyö kyi shyab drang chok gyur né
May I be born as your foremost attendant,
chang chub chö la nyam du jukpar shok
So that we may act together to bring about awakening!

nam shyik rang nang dakpé shying chok tu
Precious lord, when you display the act of enlightenment
jé khyö ngön tsang gyawé tsül tön tsé
In a sublime, self-appearing pure realm,
dak kyang düpa dangpö dral khö dé
May I take my place among the first of your disciples,
trinlé pelwé jepo chok tu mön
And act supremely to further your enlightened deeds!

dor na da né kyewa tamché du
In short, from now onwards throughout all my future lives,
kyab chik dampa khye dang mi dral shying
May I never be apart from you, my one true refuge,
chang chub tob kyang rik kyi dakpo ru
And even once I attain enlightenment, may you be the lord of my family,
gyur né dro kham dong né trukpar shok
As we empty the realms of ordinary beings from their depths!

Rigdrol, a supreme disciple and life-long companion, Requested an aspiration to be cared for
in every lifetime,As a share of dharma to be practised throughout his life.Thus he appealed
to this old man who is nearing life's end.Still, when the most splendid plates of meat
are all piled high,The most succulent glistening fats are laid out in myriad drops,And one
is clothed in the finest, most beautiful adornments,The sweetest, most pleasant talk may
continue without end.But food without nutritious value is the enemy of the stomach,When one
is without sufficient clothing, the wind can freeze one's fingers,And without companions,
wandering afar only saddens the mind;So it best to avoid many statements that are without
meaning.

Thus, when I was severely afflicted by the cold and my fingers were numb, I, Ngawang Lodrö Tsungmé,
wrote this at the Five-Peaked Mountain.
