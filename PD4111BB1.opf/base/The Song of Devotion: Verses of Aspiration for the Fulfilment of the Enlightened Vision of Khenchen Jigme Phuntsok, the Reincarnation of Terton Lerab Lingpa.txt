Be perfectly realized, and so bring inspiration to beings throughout the whole of space,

And may we all never be separated from the teachers of the supreme vehicle,

So that we cultivate completely the qualities of experience and realization.

Through the vast and compassionate blessings of the lamas, yidams and ḍākinīs,

Through the power of interdependence, the nature of things, which is beyond all imagining,
la lob dé dung gyurmé tob tsenpé

mön dön didak yishyin drubpar shok
May these aspirations come to pass, just as we desire!

Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok Rinpoche gave immense service to the Buddha’s precious doctrine of scripture
and realization in both teaching and practice, and he clarified the teachings of the
Ancient Translation school as his enlightened aspirations and prayers from the past came
to maturation. In his noble activity, he greatly benefited the teachings and beings by turning
the wheel of Dharma extensively and in a non-sectarian way, affecting many thousands
of devoted followers in a number of countries around the world through his wonderful aspirations
and enlightened deeds, but especially at the Larung Institute for Higher Buddhist
Studies which he founded in Serta, East Tibet.
At this unfortunate time, when he has displayed the appearance of directing his wisdom mind
into the dharmadhātu as a result of some external and internal adversities, it is extremely
important for his grief-stricken disciples to pray one-pointedly to their great teacher
and to make an offering of their practice by diligently applying themselves continuously and
without hypocrisy, as well as by keeping in their hearts his essential instructions that
distil the essence of sūtra and mantra, and not forgetting them.
So that the enlightened intentions of this great being may be fulfilled completely and to help
dispel the anguish of his disciples, I recently made this prayer. May all these aspirations
be fulfilled!

This was written by the Buddhist monk Tenzin Gyatso on the fifteenth day of the first month
of the Wood Monkey year (6th March 2004) during the seventeenth calendrical cycle. May virtue
abound!
