Prayer for the Long Life of Pema Norbu, Lord of Siddhas
by Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok

gön khyö drang mé kalpé ngön rol né
O protector, although in the past, countless aeons ago,
palchen düpé ngowor chang chub kyang
You were awakened as the essence of Palchen Düpa,
tab khé dzepé chotrul pakyé lé
Still, through the infinite magic of acting with skillful means,
shying dir shenyen chok gi kur nangwa
You appear now in this realm as the supreme spiritual guide.
drubpé wangchuk pema norbu nyi
Lord among accomplished ones, Pema Norbu,
tsé tayepé ngowor tso shyé sol
May your life remain secure within the essence of Amitāyus!
chok sum tsa sum sungmé den tu yi
Through the power and truth of the Three Jewels, Three Roots and guardian deities,
gang gi tuk la nakpé dön ta dak
May all the visionary aims and wishes within this master's enlightened mind
dé lak nyur du drubpar chin gyi lop
Be swiftly and easily accomplished — grant your blessings so that it is so!
gendün dé nam tuk tün trim tsang shying
May the community of the saṅgha live in harmony and with pure discipline,
shé dang drup la taktu jorwa dang
Always engaging in study and teaching and practice,
dro kun dé shying kyipé trashi shok
And may everything be auspicious so that all beings live in happiness and joy!

Following repeated requests from Khenpo Namdrol, who serves at the feet of this great protector,
I, Ngawang Lodrö Tsungmé, composed this spontaneously on the shore of Tso Pema (Lotus
Lake), that exceptionally sublime site created miraculously by the self-arisen Lotus King,
on the sixth day of the sixth month of the Iron Horse year of the seventeenth calendrical
cycle (1990). May its meaning be accomplished!
