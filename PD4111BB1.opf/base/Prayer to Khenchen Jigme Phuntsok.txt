Prayer to Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok
by Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok

jikmé tsö ché tsompé ter la wang
Master over the treasury of fearless debate, exposition and composition,
puntsok labpa sum gyi yönten dzok
With all the qualities of the three trainings perfectly complete,
pakyé pendé jungné rinpoché
Precious source of benefit and happiness beyond measure,
dren chok palden lamar solwa dep
Supreme guide, glorious lama, to you I pray!

Abhaya (Jigme) composed this himself in response to a request from Chöpé.
