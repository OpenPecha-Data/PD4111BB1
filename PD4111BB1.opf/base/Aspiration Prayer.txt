Aspiration Prayer
by Khenchen Tupten Chöpel

zab shyi trödral ösal dü ma ché
Profound and peaceful, free from complexity, uncompounded luminosity—
dütsi tabü chönyi dön tok né
Having realized the nectar-like nature of reality,
gang la gang dül tabkhé chöpa yi
May I gain the power to guide infinite beings
pakyé drowa drenpé tu tob shok
Through the skilful conduct of training each according to their needs.

This was spoken by Tupten Chöpel.1
