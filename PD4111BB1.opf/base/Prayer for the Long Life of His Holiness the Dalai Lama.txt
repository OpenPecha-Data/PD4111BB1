Prayer for the Long Life of His Holiness the Dalai Lama
by Khenchen Jigme Phuntsok

chen ré zik wang tukjé gyu trul gar
You are Avalokiteśvara, the magical manifestation of compassion,
gang jong drowa yong kyi kyab gön chok
Supreme refuge and protector for all the beings of the Land of Snows,
khyen tsé nü nga tendzin gyatso yi
Tenzin Gyatso, a master of wisdom, love and spiritual power:
ku tsé mingyur yün du tso shyé söl
We pray that your life-force never wavers and you remain long into the future!

lu mé kön chok sum gyi den tu yi
Through the power and truth of the unfailing Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha,
gang gi trinlé chok chur kun tu gyé
May your enlightened activity extend everywhere in all the ten directions!
shyé dön tadak gekmé nyur du drup
May all your wishes be swiftly and unobstructedly fulfilled!
sa sum wang du chépé pal tob shok
And may you gain the glory of perfect mastery over the three domains!

Thus the one called Abhayalakṣaṃkara spoke these words upon encountering the golden visage of
the great lord of refuge His Holiness the Dalai Lama on the 25th day of the fifth month
of the Iron Horse year in the seventeenth calendrical cycle. May they come to be fulfilled!
